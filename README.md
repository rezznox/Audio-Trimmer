# Audio-Trimmer
it's a script made in python for trimming an audio in several parts where there's silence.
You need to install somewhere the Scipy libraries to make it work, besides configuring all the parameters to the ones you want. You are free to improve this script or fork it but please always remember where you took it from! Thanks :)
